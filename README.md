#asteroid-todo

A demo of [asteroid](https://github.com/mondora/asteroid),
an alternative client for [Meteor](https://meteor.com).

This demo aims to show the flexibility asteroid gives to the
developer, allowing them to take advantage of most of the
great features of Meteor (data sync, federated login,
latency compensation etc) in a variety of environments.
Specifically, the browser, the Chromium platform and Cordova.

A simple to-do application is used for this purpose.  The
front-end of the application is built twice. The first time
with blaze, the canonical meteor front-end framework, the
second time with AngularJS, using asteroid as a bridge
between Angular and the Meteor back-end.

The demo can also be considered an example of how to use
asteroid.
